## Please notice

This game made for the **Game Off Github 2020** and also my first game ever, it has soo raw as graphics as gameplay too and contains numerous bugs. But, the development will be continued anyway to develop fully completed game. Thank you for your time and have fun!

## Introduction

You are a _space science engineer_.
Once, you look up to the Earth sky and thought:

- Why we always shooting, exploding, trying to kill all unknown, like barbarians centuries and centuries ago?
- Who knows, maybe in this asteroid or in piece of it, can be lyfe, just not the same life as we looking.
- What can I do to really start act as Human, and not from drilling and crashing all around, but carefully testing and studying first?

And then, you started experiment _Moon Defence_.
The experiment, that purpose to scientifically defence moon settlement by shooting droids to night sky to catch asteroids and go to study unknown.

## How to play and purpose

- Purpose - survive as long as you can.
- How - you can use droids to catch asteroids and rover to load asteroids and droids to refuel Space Module (in center).
- Every droid can be started from droid platform on the left corner (select platform and left click at any space, to deselect - right mouse click or left click again at the platform)
- Be careful: droids limited by quantity - 5pcs and they are refueling some times in that platform!
- Rover in center can pick up droids and asteroids; also it is refueling at Space Module in center and automatically unloading loaded asteroids and droids.
- Asteroid will fall every 7 seconds
- Highscore remembers records for any droids crashed and asteroids fell
- And warning: all objects destroyable - it means that droid cannot fly through droid - it will crash it. Rover cannot just move through droid - it will need load it or it can also explode. Asteroid can beat droids and rover and all buildings, so be careful.

Live long and prosper \/ :)

## Control

**Left Mouse Button** - select/deselect droid platform, select/deselect droid, select/deselect rover

**Right Mouse Button** - deselect all selected objects

**Tab on top left corner** appears to choose positions to land asteroid, to droid platform and orbit position.

**Tab on top right corner** has information about debug tools and current highscore and droid limitation.

## Known bugs

---

- **Bug:** Sometimes energy field around droid suddenly is not working, what to do
- **How to solve:** Select the droid and click button "reboot power" at the right tab.

---

- **Bug:** Droid and rover waypoints do not resetting if droid was selected and crashed.
- **How to solve:** Unfortunately this bug is not handled, please reboot game entirely, restart button in menu will not help:(

---

- Sometimes droid and asteroid suddenly disappear - reason unknown yet.. maybe by UFO:))
- Droids on air information doesn't updates correctly when droid crashes. That unfortunate, but will be solved.

Any comments and ideas very welcome!

Thank you again!
