How - you can use droids to catch asteroids
Every droid can be started from droid platform 
on left corner
Be careful: droids limit - 5 and 
they are refueling some times in that platform! 

Rover in center can pick up droids and asteroids

(in future it will be possible to build them 
from asteroids resources)
Asteroid will fall every 7 seconds

Live long and prosper \\/ :)"
